# Visual-Config-System
I decided to make Artemis's visual config system open src. With this, you can make new configs, rename configs, save changed settings and modules to existing configs, duplicate configs, and delete configs. It comes with a good design (I might improve in future) and a scroll bar (you cannot drag it yet). It also comes with an online config loader. Copy the raw link of a pastebin with settings and enter it in the Load textbox and it will load the config.
